1.0.1 - 2010-08-08

------------------

- Register all ordering adapter by default now that they can co-exist.

  out of sync when an item is deleted.
  [optilude]

- Declare ``IContainer`` support.
  [optilude]

  non-orderable content instead of raising an error.

  [witsch]

- Factor CMF out of the base classes for the new btree-based folder class
  and simplify things a bit afterwards.
